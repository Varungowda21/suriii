        <h2>1. No Strain, No Gain.</h2>
        <p>
          We often talk about doing all kinds of crazy shit -- climb mountains,
          run marathons, skydive, start businesses, travel the world, write
          books, record albums, make movies, the list is endless. Just think
          about what's on your bucket list for a second. Now, can I ask you one
          thing? Why haven't you done those things? Don't shy away from hard
          things. Instead, train yourself to become a person that can endure
          difficulties. The answer almost always comes down to this: It's hard.
          Well, I hate to break it to you, but life is SUPPOSED to be hard!
          That's probably the most valuable lesson I've learned. Don't shy away
          from hard things. Instead, train yourself to become a person that can
          endure difficulties. Physically and mentally.

        <h2>2. Avoid Negativity At All Cost.</h2>
        <p>
          Again, everybody knows this, but I almost never see people apply this
          in their life. They put up with negativity at work, at home, with
          their friends, family. And it's not weird. Because everywhere you
          look, there's negativity. In fact, people are inherently negative.
          That's how we're hardwired. That's why you see so much complaining,
          lying, blaming, backstabbing, jealousy, bullying, in the world. Time
          Is More Valuable Than Money. But here's the thing: All those things
          keep you from living a healthy and wealthy life. So why do you let
          yourself be exposed to negativity? The problem with us, humans, is
          that we always see the good in people. He means well. She'll turn
          around. He didn't mean to hurt me. Things will change.

        <h2>3. Time Is More Valuable Than Money</h2>
        <p>
          Out of all the resources in the world, time is the most valuable
          resource you have. "Yeah dude, I know that by now." But why do we
          collectively spend time like we have an unlimited supply of it? Do you
          ever stop and think about how much time you have left on this earth?
          Let's say you get to live to 80 years. Just do the math. It's not that
          long if you keep wasting your time. Be more selective with your time.
          Don't squander it like you can always get it back. Sure, you can
          always earn back the money that you've spent, but you can never earn
          back time. Once you spend time, it's lost forever.
